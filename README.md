In the early 2010s I wrote a few blog posts about technology while traveling
APAC with my wife. Much of it is useless these days, but a series of articles
called [Python's Innards] may still be of value (and still gets regular traffic).

[Python's Innards]: https://tech.blog.aknin.name/category/my-projects/pythons-innards/

Python's Innards was my documentation of a journey into the implementation of
CPython and how it works under the hood. A *lot* has changed in Python since then,
but enough of the internals are still relevant.

Mainly for that series I dumped the old Wordpress blog into this static site.
Some text got mangled, but the original may still be accessible [here][original].
I doubt I'll bother correcting anything else here or otherwise modernize it, it
is what it is.

Nothing to write home about.
